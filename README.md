# A Better Vanilla, a Minecraft texture pack

this texture pack has mostly some stuff i made (like items, blocks and shit), while other stuff (like the gui and xp bar) i took from https://vanillatweaks.net/

# Installation

just place the folder in `.minecraft\resourcepacks`, should work just fine from there

see "Patch Notes.txt" for changes and shit lol
